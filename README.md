# rhtlogger
A temperature/relative humidity Arduino data logger. A sensor detects the current temperature and relative humidity. An LCD display updates every 3 seconds, and the values are logged to file every 30 seconds.

## Status

I soldered everything on to the proto shield, but I couldn't get the system to work reliably after that. I decided to completely redo everything using a Pro Mini because the stacking shields were annoying me. All of the new parts are still compatible with the same code.

## Parts Used

- Pro Mini Clone (5V) http://www.ebay.com/itm/231348215568 -- I especially like this new model because the A4/A5 I2C pins are in a much more convenient location
- Micro SD Card SPI module http://www.ebay.com/itm/Micro-SD-and-Memory-Card-Breakout-Shield-Module-via-SPI-For-Arduino-Regulated-/131426645939 - one that says Catalex on the back and has a voltage regulator
- DS3231 RTC http://www.ebay.com/itm/191782504379
- Clone of Sparkfun RHT Board HTU21D http://www.ebay.com/itm/310951642577?_trksid=p2057872.m2749.l2649&ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT (original: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12064)
- 5V to 3.3V stepdown module http://www.ebay.com/itm/111896908030 (for the sensor, which is 3.3V)
- Frentaly i2c LCD http://www.ebay.com/itm/IIC-I2C-TWI-1602-Serial-Blue-Backlight-LCD-Display-For-Arduino-/221935534466?roken=cUgayN&soutkn=mKrU7F
- Momentary button https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11993
- 10k Î© resistor

Removed:
- SainSmart Arduino Uno http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00E5WJSHK
- Arrela Data Logger Shield http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00KHYHKT8 (I see this is no longer available - http://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00M1M8N90/ is probably a comparable replacement)
- tiny breadboard and/or protoshield with tiny breadboard http://www.ebay.com/itm/221739124245
- DHT22 sensor https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10167

## Libraries Used
