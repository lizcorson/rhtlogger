# rhtlogger
Just a simple little temperature/relative humidity Arduino data logger. A sensor detects the current temperature and relative humidity. An LCD display updates every 3 seconds, and the values are logged to file every 30 seconds.

## Status

The next step is to solder everything onto a protoboard and to make a case. I've also added a tutorial if you want to replicate my project: https://github.com/lizcorson/rhtlogger/blob/master/tutorial.md

## Photo

These photos show both a DHT22 and an HTU21D, but I am only using the HTU21D now.
